# Still Shows "No Deployment"

The domains still show "No Deployment". Let me check the Deployments tab.

## What to Do:

1. Click the **"Deployments"** tab at the top
2. Look for any deployments listed
3. Tell me what you see

Are there deployments listed? Or does it say "No deployments"?

**If there are deployments:**
- Click the "..." menu on the latest one
- Click "Promote to Production"

**If there are no deployments:**
- The build might have failed
- Tell me what you see

What do you see in the Deployments tab?
