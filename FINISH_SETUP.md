# ðŸŽ¯ Finish Setup - Last 2 Steps!

Everything is ready. You just need to complete these 2 simple steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

Go to: **https://github.com/new**

- Repository name: `clientfuse-website` (or whatever you want)
- Description: "Marketing website for ClientFuse.io"
- **Make it Public** (required for free Vercel deployment)
- **DON'T** add README, license, or .gitignore (we have these)
- Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Tell Me When It's Ready

Once you've created the repo, just say:

> "Created! Username: YOUR_USERNAME, Repo: clientfuse-website"

Then I'll instantly:
- âœ… Connect your local code to GitHub
- âœ… Push everything up
- âœ… Give you the exact Vercel deployment link

**OR** run this command yourself:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clientfuse-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (Auto-Updates Enabled!)

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com**
2. Click **"Add New Project"**
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Click **"Deploy"** (no configuration needed!)
5. Your site goes live in 30 seconds!

**After this, every time you run `git push`, your site updates automatically!**
