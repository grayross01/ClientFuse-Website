            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Key Considerations for Choosing a Platform</h2>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Team Size and Collaboration Needs</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              If you have multiple team members working on accounts, look for platforms with strong collaboration features like Cloud Campaign. For smaller teams, more affordable options like Social Pilot might suffice.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Client Reporting Requirements</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Agencies that need to deliver detailed, white-labeled reports will benefit from platforms like Cloud Campaign or Metricool, which offer superior analytics and customization options.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Budget and Growth Plans</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Consider not just current pricing but how costs scale as you add clients and team members. Cloud Campaign offers the best scalability for growing agencies, while Metricool provides excellent value for budget-conscious teams.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Platform Support</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Ensure the platform supports all social media channels your clients use. Most platforms cover Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn, but verify support for TikTok, Pinterest, and other emerging platforms if relevant.
            </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Our Recommendation</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <strong>For most agencies:</strong> Cloud Campaign offers the best balance of features, scalability, and agency-specific tools. Its white-label reporting and multi-client management make it ideal for agencies handling multiple clients.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>For analytics-focused agencies:</strong> Metricool provides exceptional value for agencies that need deep analytics and competitive intelligence without breaking the budget.

            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Final Thoughts</h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The best social media management platform for your agency depends on your specific needs, team size, client requirements, and growth trajectory. While Cloud Campaign emerges as the top choice for most agencies due to its comprehensive feature set and agency-specific focus, Metricool offers outstanding value for analytics-focused teams.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Remember that switching platforms mid-relationship with clients can be disruptive, so choose a platform that can scale with your agency. Consider taking advantage of free trials to test each platform with your actual workflows before making a commitment.
            </p>
