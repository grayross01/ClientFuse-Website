# Fix the Configuration

You have BOTH options selected. You need to choose ONE.

## Do This:

1. **UNCHECK** "Redirect to Another Domain" (click the circle to deselect it)
2. **KEEP** "Connect to an environment" selected (it should be selected)
3. **Make sure** "Production" is selected in the dropdown
4. Click **"Save"** button

This will connect your domain directly to your site instead of redirecting.

**After you click Save, tell me what you see!**
