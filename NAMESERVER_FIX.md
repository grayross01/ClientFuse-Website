# Fix Nameserver Issue

## The Problem:
Your nameservers aren't managed by GoDaddy, so you can't add DNS records there.

## Find Where Your Nameservers Point:

1. **Stay in GoDaddy**
2. Click the **"Nameservers"** tab
3. You'll see where your nameservers are pointing
4. Tell me what nameservers you see

They might look like:
- ns1.cloudflare.com
- ns2.cloudflare.com
- OR some other service

## Then I'll Tell You:
- Where to add the DNS records
- How to add them

**What nameservers do you see?**
