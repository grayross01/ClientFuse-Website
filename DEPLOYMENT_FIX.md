# DNS is Working - But Need Production Deployment

Good news! Your DNS is working - the domain is pointing to Vercel.

Bad news: There's no production deployment yet.

## Fix This:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Look for your latest deployment
4. Click the "..." menu on it
5. Click "Promote to Production"

OR

Tell me "deploy" and I'll push a change to trigger deployment.

**Once you have a production deployment, your site will work at clientfuse.io!**

What do you see in the Deployments tab?
