# Connect Different GitHub Account to Vercel

## Option 1: Add the Account to Vercel

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click your profile icon (top right)
3. Click **"Settings"**
4. Click **"Git"** in the left sidebar
5. Click **"Add Account"** next to GitHub
6. Sign in with your **rgray-cc** account
7. Go back to your project
8. Settings → Git → Connect Repository
9. Now you should see **rgray-cc** account repositories

## Option 2: Transfer the Repository

If you own both accounts, you could transfer the repository from rgray-cc to grayross01.

## Option 3: Use Vercel CLI

I can help you deploy using Vercel CLI instead of GitHub integration.
