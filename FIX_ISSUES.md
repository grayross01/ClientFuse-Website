# Two Issues to Fix

## Issue 1: No Production Deployment
Your site shows "No Deployment". We need to deploy first.

## Issue 2: Invalid DNS Configuration
Your domains need DNS records added.

## Fix Issue 1 First: Deploy to Production

**Option A: Push to trigger deployment**
I can push a small change to trigger Vercel deployment

**Option B: Deploy manually**
Go to your Vercel dashboard → Click "Deployments" → Find latest → Click "..." → "Promote to Production"

Which do you prefer?
