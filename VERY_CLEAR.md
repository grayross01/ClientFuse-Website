# VERY CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS

Look at the screen. You see TWO radio buttons:

1. "Connect to an environment" ← Keep this SELECTED
2. "Redirect to Another Domain" ← CLICK THIS to DESELECT

## The Problem:
You have BOTH selected. That's why it says "Invalid Configuration"

## The Fix:
Click on the circle next to "Redirect to Another Domain" to UNCHECK it.

Only "Connect to an environment" should be selected.

Then click "Save"
