# Fix Both Issues

## Issue 1: No Production Deployment
Your domains show "No Deployment". 

**To fix:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Deployments" tab (top)
3. Find your latest deployment
4. Click the "..." menu on it
5. Click "Promote to Production"

OR

Just tell me "deploy" and I'll trigger a new deployment.

## Issue 2: Invalid DNS Configuration
After you have a deployment, Vercel will show DNS records to add.

**Next steps:**
1. Click "Edit" on clientfuse.io domain
2. Vercel will show DNS records to add
3. Tell me where you host your domain (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
4. I'll give you exact instructions to add them

**Do you want me to trigger a deployment now?**
