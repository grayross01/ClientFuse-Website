# Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Everything is ready! Here's what to do:

### Option 1: The Fastest Way (I'll guide you)

**Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `clientfuse-website` (or any name you like)
3. **Important:** Don't check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
4. Click "Create repository"

**Step 2: Tell me your GitHub details**

Once you've created the repo, tell me:
- Your GitHub username (e.g., `rossgray`)
- The repository name (e.g., `clientfuse-website`)

Then I'll connect everything and push your code!

**Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (Auto-Updates Enabled)**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your `clientfuse-website` repository
5. Click "Deploy" (uses default settings)
6. Done! 🎉

**Your site will now auto-update every time you (or I) push to GitHub!**

### Option 2: Do It Yourself

If you prefer to run the commands yourself:

```bash
# 1. Create repo on GitHub first (see Step 1 above)

# 2. Connect and push
./scripts/setup-github.sh YOUR_USERNAME REPO_NAME

# 3. Then deploy to Vercel (see Step 3 above)
```

## 🧪 Test Locally First

Want to see your website before deploying?

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open: http://localhost:3000

## 📝 Notes

- ✅ Git repository is initialized
- ✅ All code is committed
- ✅ Ready to push to GitHub
- ✅ Auto-deployment will work once connected to Vercel/Netlify

**Just need:**
1. Your GitHub username
2. Your new repository name

Then I'll finish the setup for you!
