# How to View Your Website

## Option 1: Your Live Site (Recommended!)
Check your Vercel dashboard for the URL:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Sign in
3. Click on your "ClientFuse-Website" project
4. Your live URL will be shown (something like: clientfuse-website.vercel.app)

## Option 2: View Locally
Run this command in Terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/rossgray/Desktop/ClientFuse-Website
npm run dev
```

Then open: http://localhost:3000

## Option 3: I Can Give You the URL
If you tell me your Vercel URL, I can confirm it's working!
