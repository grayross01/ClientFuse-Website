# I Don't Have Access to grayross01

I only have credentials for the **rgray-cc** account.

## Your Options:

**Option 1: Push Yourself (Easiest)**
Run in Terminal:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
Enter your grayross01 password when prompted

**Option 2: Keep Using rgray-cc**
The repository is already at rgray-cc/ClientFuse-Website
Just connect Vercel to that account

**Option 3: Use Both Accounts**
Keep the code at rgray-cc and connect Vercel to that

**Which do you prefer?**
